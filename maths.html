			<h1 id="title">Mathematics</h1>

								<p>I've retired from mathematics, but I did my PhD at Newcastle on
			functional analysis, in particular in operator
			theory. Most of my research focussed on applying operator
			theoretical techniques to complex
			analysis problems, and
			vice versa, using Hardy spaces</p>
			
			<p>I'll keep all my old papers up here though, so you'll always
			be able to get hold of my work.</p>
			<h2 id="d-Papers.html">Mathematical Papers</h2>

			<h3 id="c03-Thesis.html">Some Applications of the Theory of Test Function Realisations</h3>
			
			<p>This is my PhD thesis. It's mostly taken from the papers <em>Counterexamples
			to Rational Dilation on Multiply Connected Domains</em> and <em>Test Functions
			in Constrained Interpolation</em>. However, some previously omitted proofs
			are included, and there is more background, and discussion of possible
			future work, so it may be more appropriate for researchers who
			are new to the field.</p>
			
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			
			<p>We give two applications of the theory of test function realisations.
			These were developed in connection with interpolation problems.
			In the first, we use test function methods to construct a counterexample
			to the rational dilation conjecture. That is, we give a class of spaces and
			operators on them, such that the operators do not have rational boundary
			dilations. The second is a test function realisation for the algebra of
			functions on the disc with zero derivative at the origin. The methods
			used in this second application could also be used to find test function
			realisations for other algebras, or in interpolation problems.</p>

			in Constrained Interpolation</h3>
			
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			
			<p> We give a set of test functions for 
				<m:math>
					<m:msubsup>
						<m:mi>H</m:mi>
						<m:mn>1</m:mn>
						<m:mo>∞</m:mo>
					</m:msubsup>
				</m:math>,
			an algebra of holomorphic functions with constraints on derivatives,
			whose interpolation problem was studied by Davidson, Paulsen,
			Raghupathi and Singh. We show that this set of test functions
			is minimal, by relating these ideas to realisation and interpolation problems.</p>

			<h3  id="c01-Hyperelliptic.html">Counterexamples
			to Rational Dilation on Symmetric Multiply Connected Domains</h3>
			
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			
			<p>We show that if <m:math><m:mi>R</m:mi></m:math> is a compact domain in the complex plane
			with two or more holes and an anticonformal involution onto itself (or
			equivalently a hyperelliptic Schottky double), then there is an
			operator <m:math><m:mi>T</m:mi></m:math> which has
			<m:math><m:mi>R</m:mi></m:math> as a spectral set, but does not dilate to a normal
			operator with spectrum on the boundary of <m:math><m:mi>R</m:mi></m:math>.</p>

			<p>I gave this talk at IWOTA 2010, to an audience of operator theorists.
			I introduce the idea of a collection of test

			new, finitely generated sets), and discuss what can
			and can't be done with these examples. The talk includes a handout,
			with some useful theorems.</p>
