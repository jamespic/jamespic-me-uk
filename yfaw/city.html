			<h1 id="title">The City</h1>
			
			<p>Newcastle is a vibrant city, with the university at its heart. It has an excellent public transport system,
			the Tyne and Wear metro, good transport links to the rest of the country, and an international airport.</p>
			
			<p>The University of Newcastle is ranked highly for its research, and its student life. The university can be easily reached
			by metro, and is situated within easy walking distance of the centre of town and Newcastle Central station.</p>
			
			<h2 id="Travel">Travel</h2>
			
			<p>You may also wish to see <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/visit/travel/">the university's official page on travel</a>.
			If you would prefer to use your own maps, or Sat Nav, the university's postcode is NE1 7RU.</p>
			
			<h3>Getting To The University From The City</h3>
			
			<p>The university is situated close to Haymarket metro station, towards the north of the city centre.
			Most of the city is located in Metro Zone 1, and an all day Zone 1 ticket will cost £1.90. The airport and ferry port are in Zone 3,
			and a one way ticket into the city will cost £2.90. Metro trains run every 6 minutes in Zone 1, and every 12 minutes 
			in the outer zones. See <a href="https://www.nexus.org.uk/">here</a> for more information about public transport in the city</p>
			
			<p>The Department of Mathematics is situated in the Herschel Building – The tall, slate covered building, visible from
			Haymarket Metro Station. The seminar rooms are all located on the fourth floor, and the common room is
			spread over the seventh and eighth floors.</p>
			
			<p>The city centre is quite compact, so you can easily get around on foot. See
			<a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/visit/maps.htm">maps</a> for further information</p>
			
			<h3>By Train</h3>
			
			<p >Newcastle Central Station is situated right in the centre of the city, and is two metro stops, or
			15 minutes walk from the university. Newcastle is on the East Coast Mainline, and has regular, fast train
			services to London, Birmingham and Edinburgh. For information on connections to other rail services, see
			<a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">the National Rail website</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>By Plane</h3>
			
			<p><a href="https://www.newcastleairport.com/">Newcastle International Airport</a> has regular flights to
			and from the UK and continental Europe. The airport is 25 minutes Metro ride from the city centre.</p>
			
			<h3>By Car</h3>
			
			<p>Newcastle is a difficult city to drive around. The bridges are a major bottleneck for traffic,
			the city's one way system can be infuriating, there are few parking spaces in the city centre,
			and (perhaps as a result) drivers can be quite aggressive. You should think
			carefully before deciding to drive to Newcastle, particularly as the
			city is well laid out for pedestrians, and has an excellent public transport system.</p>
			
			<p>If you are travelling by car, the university provides
			<a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/visit/travel/car.htm">advice on this</a>.</p>
			
			<h2 id="Accom">Accomodation</h2>
			
			<p>Newcastle city council provides
			<a href="https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/accommodation?opendocument">information
			on hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfasts,
			hostels and campsites in the city</a>.</p>
