			<h1 id="title">Computer Stuff</h1>

								<p>I run Ubuntu Linux as my main OS these days, and as anyone who
			runs an open source operating system knows, the temptation to tinker
			can be hard to ignore. Occasionally, that tinkering pays off, and this
			page has a few bits and pieces that some of you may find interesting.</p>
			<h2  id="a04-Latex.html">Some LaTeX Styles</h2>
			
			<p>In the course of my maths PhD, I've had to develop a couple of new
			style files for LaTeX, where stock LaTeX was missing the features I needed.
			Previously, these style files were buried in the source code for LaTeX
			documents that no-one was likely to look at, so I decided to package them up
			so anyone could find and use them.</p>
			
			<h3>Thesis Titlepages for <code>amsbook</code></h3>
			
			<p>My university, like many others, has pretty anal regulations about
			the layout of thesis title pages. Unfortunately, document classes
			such as <code>amsbook</code> don't include the necessary fields
			on their title pages by default, so it's necessary to use custom code.</p>
			
			<p>There are currently two main ways people deal with this, and I'll 
			explain why I don't like either of them:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Template files:</strong> At most universities, the most experienced LaTeX
				user has usually made up a thesis template, that anyone is free to use.
				These are perfect if you're just starting out, as they give you a ready-made
				template to start from. However, they're no good if you've already started
				writing your thesis. Even if they can be added to an existing thesis (by means
				of a style file, for example), they can be problematic, as they usually
				auto-include various packages and macros that you may not want, and
				mean adding kludgy, non-standard code.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Custom Made Title Pages</strong>: If you're an experienced LaTeX user,
				creating a custom titlepage with the <code>\begin{titlepage}</code> environment
				isn't too tricky. However, you then need to modify headings to include titles
				or authors, and it means messy non-standard code. In particular, if you're using something
				like LyX that creates titles with <code>\maketitle</code>, you're boned.
				Also, it breaks the separation between content and style that LaTeX values so
				highly</li>
			</ul> 
			
			<p>My new <code>theshead.sty</code> LaTeX style automatically tweaks the
			title page to conform to the Newcastle University thesis submission guidelines,
			when used in an <code>amsbook</code> document.
			It doesn't require any changes to the structure
			of the document, and where possible, it uses information provided by the
			<code>amsbook</code> class (like <code>\title</code>, <code>\author</code>,
			<code>\address</code> and <code>\date</code>), as well as adding a couple
			of other fields, in a similar vein (<code>\degreeclass</code> and <code>\logo</code>).
			It works with LyX, and doesn't change anything beyond the title page.</p>
			
			<h3>Colour Changes in The Beamer <code>smoothtree</code> Theme</h3>
			
			<p>In my Beamer presentations, I like to have different colour for sections on
			different subjects. With most Beamer themes, you can acomplish this with code like</p>
			
			<code>\definecolor{refresh}{RGB}{255,0,0}<br />
			\setbeamercolor{structure}{fg=refresh}</code>
			
			<p>which gives subsequent slides a red colour scheme. However, the
			<code>smoothtree</code> theme
			doesn't work properly with this code, as it fixes some of the colours at the beginning of the
			document.</p>
			
			<p><code>NewSmooth.sty</code> is a slight modification of the <code>smoothtree</code>
			theme, that removes this limitation. It slows down compilation a touch, but on modern computers
			this means less than a second's difference.</p>
			
			<p>Both style files <a href="comp/latex.zip">are available in this archive</a></p>
			
			<p><code>NewSmooth.sty</code> can be distributed under the GPL v2, or the LPPL v1.3.
			<code>theshead.sty</code> can only be distributed under the LPPL v1.3. This is due to code inherited from
			other style files.</p>
			<h2 id="a01-Roshambo.html">Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
			
			<p>A few years ago, I discovered that a friend of mine could consistently
			beat another friend of mine at rock, paper, scissors. The friend in
			question was reasonably bright&nbsp;– he wasn't just playing "rock"
			every time&nbsp;– and that set me off wondering if a computer could
			do the same.</p>
			
			<p>Apparently I wasn't the first to ask this question; it turns
			out the University of Alberta had been running a computer <a href="https://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsbpc.html">Rock
			Paper Scissors competition</a> for a couple of years. I thought
			it'd be interesting to pit the best of the bots against a human player,
			so I got the testing suite they used, and made some modifications to
			allow a human to compete instead. The package includes the source, a
			windows version, and a linux version. Go ahead and try it out.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><a href="comp/Roshambo/roshambo.zip">zip file</a></li>
				<li><a href="comp/Roshambo/roshambo.tar.bz2">tarball</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="a00-Links.html">Links</h2>
			
			<p>I can't take any credit for these things, but I've found them
			useful; so might you.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/ultimate-gnome/">Ultimate
				Gnome</a>: Not as macho as it sounds. A nice scalable icon set
				for GNOME.</li>
				
				<li><a href="https://software.xfx.net/utilities/sss/index.htm">xFX
				Screensaver Settings</a>: A replacement for
				gnome-screensaver-preferences, which gives you access to more settings.</li>
			</ul>
