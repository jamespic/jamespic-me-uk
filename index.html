					<h2 id="a011-TrustIV.html">New New Blog 
<span class="subtitle">Friday, 1st March 2013</span></h2>

<p>I haven't updated this site in a while – partly because the PHP
I wrote wasn't as convenient as I'd hoped. So, I've given up trying to
maintain my own site, and started a blog on wordpress.com.</p>

<p>I'll leave this site up for posterity (it's about the only place
I can legally self-host my academic papers anyway), but new content
will go to either
<a href="https://jamespicuk.wordpress.com/">my wordpress blog</a>, or to 
<a href="https://blog.trustiv.co.uk/">TrustIV's new blog</a>.</p>

<p>I might also update some of the content of my old blog and move it
across – if I still agree with the things I wrote 2 years ago.</p>

<h2 id="a011-TrustIV.html">Big News, and Big Changes 
<span class="subtitle">Wednesday, 27th October 2010</span></h2>

<p>There's been a lot of change lately, both in my life, and on this site.</p>

<p>Firstly, I've left mathematics. Pursuing a career in mathematics any further
would have meant some very difficult life changes, so I decided to look elsewhere.
I've started a job at <a href="https://www.trustiv.co.uk/">TrustIV</a>, a small
performance testing consultancy – actually, I started a couple of months ago, but I
haven't had much chance to update the site.</p>

<p>To document my experiences in the world of performance testing,
<a href="perf.html">I've started a blog</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, on a loosely related note, part of the reason I'd held off updating the site
is that the flat XHTML had become unmaintainable. To make it a little easier
to keep the website up to date, I've written some simple PHP to help me
manage content.</p>

			<h2 id="a010-IWOTA2010.html">IWOTA 2010 
			<span class="subtitle">Tuesday, 20th July 2010</span></h2>
			
			<p>I gave a talk at IWOTA 2010, in Berlin. The talk was entitled
			"Examples and Applications of Test Functions". You can read it
			<a href="maths.html#IWOTA2010">here</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="a009-LaTeX.html">LaTeX Packages 
			<span class="subtitle">Thursday, 3rd June 2010</span></h2>
			
			<p>In the course of my PhD, I've had to write a couple of custom LaTeX style files. Most recently,
			I wrote a custom style file that makes it easy to add a 
			(properly formatted, university spec) title page to theses written in <code>amsbook</code>. Previously I also
			made some modifications to my favourite Beamer theme, to allow colour changes midway through
			a presentation.</p>
			
			<p>These style files were buried in the source code for various documents, but I
			decided to package them up and release them on their own.</p>
			
			<p>Find them <a href="comp.html#Latex">here</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="a007-Thesis.html">Thesis Submitted 
			<span class="subtitle">Wednesday, 24th March 2010</span></h2>
			
			<p>I've finally got my thesis submitted to the bureaucrats, so this
			seems like a good time to put it online. It's basically
			my two previous papers stuck together, so if you're
			already familiar with these, there's no reason to read my thesis.
			I'm porting any relevant corrections (referee's comments, examiner's
			corrections) between documents, so there shouldn't be
			any more mistakes in the "older" documents.</p>
			
			<p>However, there are some differences. There's some extra discussion
			in the thesis, particularly of background, and potential future research directions,
			a few of the proofs are more detailed, and the thesis is more
			self-contained, so the thesis may be a better place
			to start for some (particularly if you're new to the field).</p>
			
			<p>As always, examiners comments (as well as referees comments, as they come in)
			will be retroactively applied to the version of the thesis found here, so the version on
			here is always the most up to date version. Find the thesis <a href="maths.html">here</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="a006-YFAW.html">Young Functional Analysts' Workshop 2010
			<span class="subtitle">Friday, 20th November 2009</span></h2>
			
			<p>From the 11th to the 13th of January 2010, Newcastle will be hosting a workshop on
			functional analysis for PhD students and postdocs. This is the follow-up to last year's
			Analytic Function Spaces Mini-meeting. For more details, see <a href="yfaw/index.html">here</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="a005-IWOTA2009.html">Presentation at IWOTA 2009
			<span class="subtitle">Sunday, 20th September 2009</span></h2>
			
			<p>I'm scheduled to give a talk at IWOTA 2009 on the 22nd of September,
			in sunny Guanajuato, Mexico. I'll be talking about Test Function Realisations and
			Agler-Herglotz Representations. You can read my talk
			<a href="maths.html">here</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="a003-H1Infinity.html">New Paper
			 <span class="subtitle">Thursday, 6th November 2008</span></h2>
			
			<p>I'm working on a new paper, on test functions in constrained interpolation.
			At the moment, it's not even ArXiv quality, but
			it's still potentially useful, and it'll be updated as and when I get chance.
			Find it <a href="maths.html">here</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="a001-Welcome.html">Grand
			Opening <span class="subtitle">Sunday,
			22nd June 2008</span></h2>
			
			<p>Welcome to my
			new website. For those of you who don't know me,
			my name's James Pickering, and I'm a PhD student in pure mathematics.
			Over the coming months and years, I'll be using this website to host
			material related to my research&nbsp;– papers, preprints,
			presentations etc.&nbsp;– as well as other&nbsp;stuff, such as
			useful computery bits; basically anything that doesn't really belong on
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>.</p>
			
			<p>Please, make yourself at home,<br />
			James. </p>
